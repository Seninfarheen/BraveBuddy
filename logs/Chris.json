Sammy had the fluffiest tail and loved to collect shiny acorns. One sunny day, while he was hopping around, he heard a soft crying sound coming from behind a big tree.\n\nSammy peeked around the trunk and found a little bird named Bella. She was sad because she lost her way back to her nest high in the tree! Sammy wanted to help. He remembered how he had climbed tall trees before, so he said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Bella! I\u2019ll help you get home!\u201d\n\nWith his brave squirrel heart, Sammy climbed the tallest tree, all the way to the top! He found Bella's nest and told her to follow him. Bella flapped her tiny wings and zoomed up behind him. Finally, they reached her nest, and Bella was so happy!\n\n\u201cThank you, Sammy! You are my hero!\u201d she chirped with joy. Sammy felt super proud because he was brave and helped a friend!\n\nAnd from that day on, Sammy and Bella became the best of buddies, always looking out for each other in their magical forest!\n\nThe end! What do you think, Chris? Do you have a favorite animal like Sammy or Bella?"
